<p>
	<b>1/17/25: using random to pick day of year</b>
	<br>
	Made a site that picks a random day of a year. I did this in slot machine format. Trying to add more to that, so when it lands on a specific holiday you get a point. For example, if it landed on Christmas, a point would be added. Also used arrays to do this.
	
</p>
<p>
	<b>2/11/25: valentines </b><br>
	Made a valentines project for house! used things liked arrays, the random function, confetti, and more.

</p>
<p>
	<b>2/28/25: learning in class</b><br>
	In class today we clarified some questions about for loops, apendChild, and more. For me specifically, I got a lot of clarification about different classes, and putting specific functions within other ones. To do this, you could use already made functions, and then your own. This was confusing to me before because I didn't exactly get the format. The appendChild function also helps put things within other functions. In general, a lot of structure was clarified for me today.
